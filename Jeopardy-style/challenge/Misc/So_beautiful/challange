Task: Everyone knows that Steffen has a soft spot when it comes to beautiful things, just a much as he like technology. So for some time, he has been collecting images of flowers that he finds beautiful and stored it on GitHub, as others can enjoy the collection. Sadly, Steffen does not know how to git should be used properly. Anyways, Go check out the collection and enjoy the beautiful flowers.
