Task: Now that EAL wish to charge all the students for using the Wifi connection, some students have started a rebel group where they fight for free wifi. Their first move was to try and access the wifi connection in the build next door. They have done some of the work, and captured a 4 way-handshake. Can you help the group get free wifi for everyone?
