Task: There is a lot of secrets at EAL these days. So to make sure that the students do not understand what they are talking about, they have invented their own spoken language, called "Gip-arish".

Examples of Gip-arish:
1: ejp mysljylc kd kxveddknmc re jsicpdrysi
2: rbcpc ypc rtcsra dkh wyfrepkym veddknkmkrkcd
3: de kr kd eoya kw aej tysr re ujdr lkgc jv

English:
1: our language is impossible to understand
2: there are twenty six factorial possibilities
3: so it is okay if you want to just give up

Your task is to make an application that can translate "Gip-arish" into english so that the staff at EAL cannot have any secrets for the students anymore.
