Johnny is a new and fresh Computer Science student at EAL. He has always had a huge dream of becoming a programmer, make $dollars$ and gets all the ladies (That's what programmers do, right?).

For a long time, Johnny makes a lot of cool applications while he was at this first school year. He makes an application where he could click a button and an image changed to another one. He made an application where he could put in two numbers, click another button and it would show the sum of the two numbers... He even made an application that who do something in one case and something else in another - This is just amazing!!

At some point in his education, he started learning about making network application. Now there was no turning back - All the options for remaking application was endless. He made an application that would give two numbers for addition and expect to receive a number as the result of the sum.

e.g.

Input:
