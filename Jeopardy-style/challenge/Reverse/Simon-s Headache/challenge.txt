Task: The silly professor Simon decided to hide a very important key in a text file. Since Simon didn't want anyone to know the content of the file,
he encrypted the key very hard.
In order to be able to retrieve the key, Simon wrote a program that could decrypt the file... the only problem was...
for some reason, the program isn't working anymore. Simon had hardcoded the password for the encryption
inside the executable so that no one would be able to access it, however, Simon no longer remembered what the password was :(

Maybe you and your team can help Simon retrieve the key.
