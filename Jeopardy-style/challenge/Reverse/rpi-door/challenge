Task: "We have this here project at school, where we need to work with some Raspberry Pi. All the equipment for the project, have been handed out by our super annoying technology teacher. Sadly we've lost the SD card for our Raspberry Pi. So, instead of going to our annoying teacher, we bought a new card and got a copy of the data from another group. BUT, something dosn't seem right... Can you help us out with locating what have been changed?
