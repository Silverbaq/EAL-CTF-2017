Description: LXDE configuration data
 LXDE (the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is a project aimed
 to provide a desktop environment which is lightweight and fast.
 .
 It's not designed to be powerful and bloated, but to be usable and slim
 enough, and keep the resource usage low. Different from other desktop
 environments, LXDE doesn't tightly integrate every component. Instead,
 LXDE tried to make all components independent, and each of them can be
 used independently with fewer dependencies.
 .
 Features:
 .
  * Lightweight, runs with reasonable memory usage
  * Fast, rund well even on older machines produced in 1999
  * Good-looking, GTK+ 2 internationalized user interface
  * Easy-to-use, the user interface is simple, but usable enough
  * Desktop independent (suprise! Every component can be used without LXDE)
  * Standard compliant, follows the specs on freedesktop.org

  * Memory usage: large, memory-hungry Python programs might end up taking less
    space than they do in CPython.
  * Compatibility: PyPy is highly compatible with existing python code.
    It supports ctypes and can run popular python libraries like twisted and django.
  * Sandboxing: PyPy provides the ability to run untrusted code in a fully secure way.
  * Stackless: PyPy comes by default with support for stackless mode, providing
    micro-threads for massive concurrency.  As well as other features.

Description: The Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: Collection of video4linux support libraries
 libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 .
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 .
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries.

Depends: debconf (>= 1.5.19), coreutils (>= 5.91)
Size: 70848
Description: Update Configuration File: preserve user changes to config files.
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: utilities for devices using the SCSI command set (shared libraries)
 Most OSes have SCSI pass-through interfaces that enable user space programs
 to send SCSI commands to a device and fetch the response. With SCSI to ATA
 Translation (SAT) many ATA disks now can process SCSI commands. Typically
 each utility in this package implements one SCSI command. See the draft
 standards at www.t10.org for SCSI command definitions plus SAT. ATA
 commands are defined in the draft standards at www.t13.org . For a mapping
 between supported SCSI and ATA commands and utility names in this package
 see the COVERAGE file
 .
 Shared library used by the utilities in the sg3-utils package.

Description: X Rendering Extension client library
 The X Rendering Extension (Render) introduces digital image composition as
 the foundation of a new rendering model within the X Window System.
 Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into
 either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the
 server and rendering sets of them.  The Xrender library exposes this
 extension to X clients.

Description: parsing library for openbox
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers.  Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly.  Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager.  It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox.  Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 This package contains the libobt library files used by openbox
 to load and parse configuration and theme files of openbox.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: report the search path for a class's ISA tree
 Suppose you have a class (like Food::Fish::Fishstick) that is derived, via
 its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as Food::Fish::Fishstick is from
 Food::Fish, Life::Fungus, and Chemicals), and some of those superclasses may
 themselves each be derived, via its @ISA, from one or more superclasses (as
 above).
 .
 When, then, you call a method in that class ($fishstick->calories), Perl
 first searches there for that method, but if it's not there, it goes
 searching in its superclasses, and so on, in a depth-first (or maybe
 "height-first" is the word) search. In the above example, it'd first look in
 Food::Fish, then Food, then Matter, then Life::Fungus, then Life, then
 Chemicals.
 .
 This library, Class::ISA, provides functions that return that list -- the
 list (in order) of names of classes Perl would search to find a method, with
 no duplicates.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

 Module::Build is a framework for easily building, testing and installing Perl
 packages. It is meant as a next-generation replacement for ExtUtils::MakeMaker
 and offers many additional features characteristic of a more modern install
 system, including simple subclassing for custom build actions.
 .
 Because it is written in Pure Perl, it has very few external dependencies. In
 particular, it allows for installation of packages on systems without 'make'
 and will even work without a shell. Its only prerequisites are modules that
 are included with perl 5.6.0 and it is core as of perl 5.10.

  * Dragging through short touching and holding down the finger on the touchpad
  * Middle and right button events on the upper and lower corner of the touchpad
  * Vertical scrolling (button four and five events) through moving the finger
    on the right side of the touchpad
  * The up/down button sends button four/five events
  * Horizontal scrolling (button six and seven events) through moving the finger
    on the lower side of the touchpad
  * The multi-buttons send button four/five events, and six/seven events for
    horizontal scrolling
  * Adjustable finger detection
  * Multifinger taps: two finger for middle button and three finger for right
    button events. (Needs hardware support. Not all models implement this
    feature.)
  * Run-time configuration using shared memory. This means you can change
    parameter settings without restarting the X server (see synclient(1)).
  * It also provides a daemon to disable touchpad while typing at the keyboard
    and thus avoid unwanted mouse movements (see syndaemon(1)).

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,
 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space
 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

  * An API for writing PID files
  * An API for serializing signals into a pipe for use with select() or poll()
  * An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 .
 Routines like these are included in most of the daemon software available. It
 is not simple to get these done right and code duplication is not acceptable.
 .
 This package includes the libdaemon run time shared library.

Description: LXDE monitor configuration tool
 LXRandR is a GUI application for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment
 (LXDE).
 .
 This is a very basic monitor config tool utilizing the X extension called
 RandR. It can let you change the screen resolution on the fly. Besides, when
 you run lxrandr with external monitor connected, its GUI will change, and show
 you some quick options to get your projector or external monitor working
 correctly.
 .
 This tool doesn't aim to be a full randr frontend. It's a utility for grandma,
 not for geeks. If you need the full power of RandR, get xrandr (console) or
 grandr (GUI) and read some tutorials.
 .
 LXRandR only gives you some easy and quick options which are intuitive. It's
 very suitable for laptop users who frequently uses projectors or external
 monitor and just want to get their work done without reading a lot of
 "geek-centered" manuals or command line tutorials.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: module to parse directory listings
 File::Listing exports a single function called parse_dir(), which can be used
 to parse directory listings.
 .
 The first parameter to parse_dir() is the directory listing to parse. It can
 be a scalar, a reference to an array of directory lines or a glob
 representing a filehandle to read the directory listing from.
 .
 The second parameter is the time zone to use when parsing time stamps in the
 listing. If this value is undefined, then the local time zone is assumed.
 .
 The third parameter is the type of listing to assume. Currently supported
 formats are 'unix', 'apache' and 'dosftp'. The default value 'unix'.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 This package contains the NTP daemon and utility programs.  An NTP
 daemon needs to be running on each host that is to have its clock
 accuracy controlled by NTP.  The same NTP daemon is also used to
 provide NTP service to other hosts.

Description: GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.
 .
 GnuPG does not use any patented algorithms. This means it cannot be
 compatible with PGP2, because that uses IDEA (which is patented in
 a number of countries).

Description: simple http server class
 Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers that listen on a
 socket for incoming requests. The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of
 IO::Socket::INET, so you can perform socket operations directly on it too.
 .
 The accept() method will return when a connection from a client is available.
 The returned value will be an HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is
 another IO::Socket::INET subclass. Calling the get_request() method on this
 object will read data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object. The
 ClientConn object also provide methods to send back various responses.
 .
 This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you. Your application, i.e. the user of
 the HTTP::Daemon is responsible for forking if that is desirable. Also note
 that the user is responsible for generating responses that conform to the
 HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Version: 0.3.4-2
Depends: libc6 (>= 2.4)
Size: 31204
Description: global hotkey daemon for Linux
 Triggerhappy watches connected input devices for certain key presses
 or other input events and runs administrator-configured
 commands when they occur. Unlike other hotkey daemons, it runs as a
 persistent, systemwide service and therefore can be used even
 outside the context of a user or X11 session.
 .
 It can handle a wide variety of devices (keyboards, joysticks,
 wiimote, etc.), as long as they are presented by the kernel as
 generic input devices. No kernel patch is required. The daemon is
 a userspace program that polls the /dev/input/event? interfaces
 for incoming key, button and switch events. A single daemon can
 monitor multiple input devices and can dynamically add additional
 ones. Hotkey handlers can be assigned to dedicated (tagged) devices
 or globally.
 .
 For example, this package might be useful on a headless system to
 use input events generated by a remote control to control an
 mpd server, but can also be used to allow the adjustment of audio
 and network status on a notebook without relying on user specific
 configuration.
 .
 Key combinations are supported as well as the hotplugging of devices
 using a udev hotplug script; the running daemon can also be influenced
 by a client program, e.g. to temporarily pause the processing of
 events or switch to a different set of hotkey bindings.

Description: rendering library for openbox themes
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers.  Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly.  Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager.  It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox.  Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 This package contains the libobrender library files used by openbox
 for theme rendering.

 needs, or roll a completely new implementation.
 .
 IJS is a client-server protocol, used to write ghostscript drivers. The
 drivers are separate programs. The client and server communicate via pipes,
 though shared memory may be used additionally in the future. Currently IJS
 is used by the hpijs and ijsgimpprint drivers.
 .
 Code for both the client- and server-side is included in the library. This

  * Lightweight runtime library (parsing of the menu definition files
    are done by menu-cache-gen when the menus are really changed).
  * Less unnecessary and complicated file monitoring.
  * Heavily reduced disk I/O.

 SASL is the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method for
 adding authentication support to connection-based protocols. To use
 SASL, a protocol includes a command for identifying and
 authenticating a user to a server and for optionally negotiating
 protection of subsequent protocol interactions. If its use is
 negotiated, a security layer is inserted between the protocol and the
 connection. See RFC 2222 for more information.
 .
 Any of: ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, GSSAPI (MIT or Heimdal
 Kerberos 5), NTLM, OTP, PLAIN, or LOGIN can be used. If you intend to

 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.
 .
 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and
 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be
 the one provided by ca-certificates.
 .
 This module used to be bundled with the libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in
 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN
 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their
 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what
 underlying modules to install.

 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Description: utility to determine the locale encoding
 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it
 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte
 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program
 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.
 .
 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions
 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.
 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET
 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding
 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be
 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and
 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GnuPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: virtual network computing server software
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a server to which X clients can connect and the
 server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 The difference between the tightvncserver and the normal vncserver is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 vncserver (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.
 .
 Note: This server does not support or need a display. You need a vncviewer to
 see something. However, this viewer may also be on a computer running other
 operating systems in the local net.

 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.

Description: standards compliant, fast, light-weight, extensible window manager
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers.  Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly.  Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager.  It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox.  Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 Some of the things to look for in Openbox are:
 .
  * ICCCM and EWMH compliance!
  * Very fast
  * Chainable key bindings
  * Customizable mouse actions
  * Window resistance
  * Multi-head Xinerama support!
  * Pipe menus
