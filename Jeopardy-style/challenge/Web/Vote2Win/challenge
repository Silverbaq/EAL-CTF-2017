Task: Since the new administration at EAL has become active things have started changing. First the prices at the cantine, then the teachers was replaces by typewriting monkeys and the hash-tables in .Net was replace with normal tabels...

Now they've got some new crazy idea - They wish that the students have to pay for the internet they use at EAL (They heard that was how they do it in China, so why not implement that here as well?).

Can you make the result become a "No" to user payment?
