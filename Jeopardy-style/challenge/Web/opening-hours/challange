Task: In many situations, Steffen gets very focused when he is working and forgets all about time and place. This resolves in him forgetting when all the shops have open. Therefore he has decided to make an application where he can lookup opening hours for different shops (Ever heard about Google?). But, as we all know, Steffen is not that good with all the different technologies that are available today. Can you see where he went wrong?
